# Payment Gateway Implementation with Microservices using Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Java17

This project is a payment gateway implementation using a microservices architecture with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Java 17. It provides a robust and scalable solution for processing payments, managing transactions, and ensuring the security of payment-related data.

## Features

- **Secure Payment Processing**: Utilize industry-standard security measures to ensure the safety of payment transactions and sensitive customer data.

- **Microservices Architecture**: The project is structured as a collection of microservices, each responsible for a specific aspect of the payment gateway functionality.

- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind, making it suitable for handling a high volume of payment requests and transactions.

- **Spring Boot**: Built on the Spring Boot framework (Java 17), allowing for rapid development and easy integration with other Spring projects.

- **Spring Cloud**: Leveraging Spring Cloud for microservices architecture, providing flexibility and resilience in a distributed environment. It includes modules like Eureka (Service Discovery), Config Server (Centralized Configuration), and Zuul (API Gateway).

- **Swagger**: Utilize Swagger for API documentation. Access the API documentation at `/swagger-ui.html` after running the application.

- **Bitbucket**: Code management, version control, and collaboration are hosted on Bitbucket.

- **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Continuous integration and deployment pipelines are set up for automated testing and deployment. CI/CD configurations are managed in Bitbucket Pipelines.

## Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud (Eureka, Config Server, Zuul)
- Swagger
- Bitbucket (for code management, CI/CD)

## Microservices

The project consists of the following microservices:

- **Payment Service**: Responsible for processing payment transactions.
- **User Service**: Manages user accounts and authentication.
- **Order Service**: Handles order creation and management.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users for successful transactions.
- **Zuul Gateway**: Acts as the API Gateway, routing requests to the appropriate microservices.
- **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management for microservices.
